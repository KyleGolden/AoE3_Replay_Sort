AOE3 Replay Sort

Age of Empires 3 replays are saved to generic default names (age3rec1.rec) which make it difficult
to find replays.

The idea of this program is to scrape these replay files for information such as player names/civs and hopefully
create a new file with a more descriptive name

currently a WIP
